# TODO

##Â General

- follow the [twelve-factor methodology](https://12factor.net)

## Features

- ~~finish the Collection in-memory implementation~~
- put a (GraphQL? REST?) API in front of said Collection
- populate Collection with a `sync.Once` scrape at startup
- gin up a TypeScript/React web app FE
  - add *'Watched'* checkboxes for every episode
  - retain check status with [Web Storage](https://caniuse.com/namevalue-storage)
  - throw [Fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) into the mix as well?

## Structure

- ~~refactor around [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)~~
- ~~run config through [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)~~
  - set default values in the `initConfig` func

        ```go
        viper.SetDefault("test", "from SetDefault in config.go")
        // viper.SetDefault("storage_type", "in-memory")
        ```

  - move config checking (currently under the root command) into its own subcommand

### API endpoints

- when serving shows, use `strings.Map()` to turn e.g. 'The Flash (The CW)' into 'theflashthecw'
  - drop the spaces/punctuation and lower-case

## Consistency

- ~~grab episodes from <https://arrowverse.info> as well, and compare~~
  - ~~run comparison with the Google `go-cmp` library~~

## Miscellaneous

- flesh out the README
  - Docker image
- `diff --recursive --exclude=.git --unidirectional-new-file . ~/git/github.com/jlucktay/template-go`
- versioning, so that something like goreleaser can bake values in using ldflags
  - `cobra.Command` has a `Version` field to populate with a string

## Logging

- wrap `zap` in [logr](https://github.com/go-logr/logr)

## Publishing
